# NewJerseyTrail
A mock version of Oregeon Trail, but in New Jersey! 

Embark on your adventure across our beautiful state as you rush to South Jersey in a rush to make your friend's wedding. You've got food, water, and gas - what trouble could you possibly have? As any New Jerseyan that's traveled the highways knows - plenty! Shore traffic, gang trouble - anything can happen!
